= Code Katas (so far only in Ruby & JavaScript) by yours truly.

== TODO:

* Game of Life on canvas: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life
* More Algorithms
* At least 1 kata in something a little less familiar...Objective C? Java?
* Redo Roman Numerals Kata, this time supporting backwards conversion + Exception handling
* Do Dave Thomas' "Data Munging" kata: http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_four_data_.html
* Fibonnaci in a few different flavors: eg: imperative, functional
