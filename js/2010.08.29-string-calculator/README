The String Calculator kata is the first one I ever tried -- had the great pleasure
of being introduced to this one by Patrick Reagan from Viget Labs.

Anyone reading my code on this one will notice right away that I get hung up on
the requirement to allow multiple delimiters. Loving Jasmine, but clearly, I'll
need to take a look at other peoples' approaches to the latter half of the exercise
before I give this one another shot.
