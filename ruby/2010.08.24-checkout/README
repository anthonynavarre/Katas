Checkout Code Kata

I owe much of this kata's success to its accompanying article on David Thomas'
CodeKata website: http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_nine_back_.html
Besides providing very clear parameters for the exercise, David also provides
a sample interface and several sample tests. I probably would have had a much
more rocky start if not for David's hints (I used several of his sample tests
for my own acceptance tests).

That being said, I feel a swell of pride with this kata, compared to the 
bowling kata I recently completed
(http://github.com/anthonynavarre/Katas/tree/master/2010.08.05-bowling-kata/),
because I required considerably less time to satisfy this kata's requirements.

Being only the 2nd kata I've attempted on my own, I already feel better about
allowing myself to write ugly code on the first pass (and trusting that I'll
come back to it very soon). That was a fun sensation, but the most interesting
part of this kata was the opportunity to use test doubles for the first time.

I've read up on test doubles, but since I'm fresh to TDD, I've never attempted
to use them in practice. I wonder if I've used the mocks in an appropriate
fashion -- it certainly isn't 2nd nature yet, as I find myself reminding myself
about the difference between mocks and stubs, second-guessing my choices with every
keystroke.

It's fun to be learning again, and I look forward to future pairings
with more experienced Rubyists so I can start to catch up on all the TDD goodness
I've been missing out on all this time.
