Roman Numerals Kata

I still need to do the 2nd part of this kata: convert in the other direction, but
the thing that occurred to me while doing the first part is that I should make it
a priority to find katas that don't tempt me to go straight to a mixin for String.

Of course, the other half of that is that I should try to do these same katas with
a totally different approach.

The other thing that this particular kata brings to mind is that most katas I've
done so far do not require that the practitioner check for invalid inputs, which is,
of course, not a luxury one can afford in the real world. Sure, these are supposed
to teach one to focus on a specific problem, but I suppose the next time I do this
kata, there won't be any harm in testing for an Exception on 'IXI' after all the
other tests are passing.
